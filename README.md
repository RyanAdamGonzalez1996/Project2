Project Name: 
Good Books Analysis

Group Members: 
Ryan Gonzalez, Benjamin Kramskoi, Saroja Shreenivasan, Celeste Muniz-Lithgow

Project Description:
By analyzing the books data, we will be creating readily available data of the good books based on review, price, etc.
Why your final database will be useful to a hypothetical organization:
An interactive database that a client can use to sort through a collection of books by rating, author, popularity(to_read list), genre, price, number of pages, language and best selling books by genre. 

Data Sources:
https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_The_New_York_Times_Fiction_Best_Sellers 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah%27s_Book_Club 

A brief summary of the three ETL steps you will take to create this database:
Extract - using python from kaggle and web scraping from  barnes and noble
Transform - using pandas, python, sql and transform the data that is extracted
Load - make a connection between pandas and postgres; load the data into the respective tables

A description of what each team member will be responsible for:
